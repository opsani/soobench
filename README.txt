Building and installing the R package on Unix/Linux systems:

Set the tools files to "executable" via
chmod a+x tools/roxygenize
chmod a+x tools/set-version

Then you can build a source package version with 
make package
or directly install with 
make install

Check the usage of make for other options with
make
