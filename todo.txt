 * Rename all generators to generate_<function name>. So
   'sphere_function' becomes 'generate_sphere_function'. See sphere.R
   for an example of what all other generators should look like.

 * (JB) More checks for arguments in generators, esp. check for NULLs.

 * Add more test cases to skel/inst/tests/.

 * Add more transformations.

 * (JB) Add a function to compute the ERT from a set of runs and also
   bootstrap variance as done in official BBOB code.

 * Improve noisy testbed.

 * For each function, research where it was first mentioned in the
   literature. Add reference to manual page and bibtex entry to
   manual/functions.bib. If paper is not available online (add link to
   BibTeX entry if it is), order it from library and add scan to
   repository.

 * Add formulas to help page of generators.

 * (JB) Improve efficiency of record_target_values_function(). 

 * Add missing generics for record_target_values_function(). 

 * (JB) Add HappyCat and Batman functions from:
