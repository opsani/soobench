 * Add more transformations.

 * Add a function to compute the ERT from a set of runs and also
   bootstrap variance as done in official BBOB code.

 * Improve noisy testbed. I.e. add more noise models: Additive
   constant and fitness proportional. Parameter noise.

 * Currently we have a lot of redundant C code for handling SEXP. The R_SOOFUNCTION
   macro is fine for test functions which expect no parameters beside the vector x.
   Unfortunately until now we have copies of the function body of R_SOOFUNCTION in
   do_bbob_eval, do_happycat_eval and do_batman_eval.

 * Check BBOB Noisy functions.
 
 * JB: Add 10 test functions from Haarala, Miettinnen, Mäkelä paper. Add appropriate tests.

 * write unit test for record_target_values_function und first_hitting_times
