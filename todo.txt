we need a function to ask the id of a function generator like sphere_function 
(would return "sphere", not "sphere-2d")

counting_function could get a vector of y-levels to compute first hitting times
--> did record_target_values_function insetad, more flexible and does not
    break old interface. export when ok 

add a function to compute ERT and boostrap same as done in BBOB
