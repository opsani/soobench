 * (BB) add something like record_x_y_values_function.
   Same as record_target_values_function but logs x too.
   First version does _not_ need to be efficient. 
   If this produces an extremely large matrix it is the user's fault,
   i want to use this mainly for smaller, shorter "test" runs to
   analyze solvers.

 * (JB) More checks for arguments in generators, esp. check for NULLs.

 * Add more test cases to skel/inst/tests/.

 * Add more transformations.

 * (JB) Add a function to compute the ERT from a set of runs and also
   bootstrap variance as done in official BBOB code.

 * Improve noisy testbed.

 * (JB) Add HappyCat and Batman functions from:

    https://homepages.fhv.at/hgb/New-Papers/PPSN12_BF12.pdf

 * Currently we have a lot of redundant C code for handling SEXP. The R_SOOFUNCTION
   macro is fine for test functions which expect no parameters beside the vector x.
   Unfortunately until now we have copies of the function body of R_SOOFUNCTION in
   do_bbob_eval, do_happycat_eval and do_batman_eval.
     
 * Noise Models: Additive constant and fitness proportional. Parameter
   noise.

 * Check BBOB Noisy functions.
