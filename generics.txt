Generics
========

This is a list of all generics that any functions that wrap
soo_function objects should implement:

 * random_parameters(n, fn) { ... }
 * recorded_values <- function(fn) { ... }

The implementation can usually be reduced to:

  <generic>.<myclass> <- function(..., fn, ...) {
    ee <- environment(fn)
    <generic>(..., ee[["<inner_function_name>"]], ...)
  }

Note
----

It would be nice if there was an automated way to test that these are
present and working. Suggestions welcome.
